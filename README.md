# colorful-dots

Colorful Dots is a game made in Swift for a Mobile App Dev class (CS 422) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. This iOS app was built by Noah Grubbs and Jesse Lam. 

Noah focused on the game and level design along with the database. Jesse worked on the front-end parts, focusing on the User Experience and User Interface along with the app's animations and audio.

Some issues faced by Noah included touch collision and trying to implement correct order whereas Jesse struggled with retrieving data across the lifecycles of different views.

There are many features that have still yet to be implemented, and this app is still work-in-progress!
