#### Description:
Colorful Dots is a game made in Swift for a Mobile App Dev class (CS 422) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. This iOS app was built by Noah Grubbs and Jesse Lam.

Noah focused on the game and level design along with the database. Jesse worked on the front-end parts, focusing on the User Experience and User Interface along with the app's animations and audio.

Some issues faced by Noah included touch collision and trying to implement correct order whereas Jesse struggled with retrieving data across the lifecycles of different views.

There are many features that have still yet to be implemented, and this app is still work-in-progress!

#### Bugs:
- The first level of each world is unlocked upon initial install!
- Random crashes during Level 15?

#### Future features:
- An undo button rather than just a retry button
- Audio sliders in the Settings
- Pause music when the app is in the background, and resume when loading back in
- Add more colors, or maybe randomize the colors in the game levels
- Arrows to move between worlds rather than just swiping
- A better tutorial with more animations
- Light mode
- Animations inside the game levels, dots expand and contract
- Post game levels after completion of all levels
- Snappier transition animations (the fade in and fade out feels sluggish)
- Title label animations on menu screen
- MORE ANIMATIONS!
- More sound effects
- Custom win sound effect for worlds
- Haptics where phone vibrates when dragging and dropping dots
- Random level generator mode
- Multiplayer mode (with different game modes!)
- Store for customization and cosmetics
